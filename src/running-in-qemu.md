# Running in QEMU

Let’s actually run our kernel! To do this, we’ll use QEMU, an emulator. Using
QEMU is fairly straightfoward:

```bash
$ qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom os.iso
```

Type it in, hit enter, and you should see Hello World!

<img alt="hello world" class="center" src="assets/hello_world.png" />

If it shows up for you too, congrats! If not, something may have gone
wrong. Double check that you followed the examples _exactly_. Maybe
you missed something, or made a mistake while copying things down.

Note all of this other stuff behind the Hello World message: This part may look different, based on your version of grub, and also since we didn’t clear the screen, everything from GRUB just stays as it is. We’ll write a function to do that eventually...

Let’s talk about this command before we move on:

```text
qemu-system-x86_64
```

We’re running the `x86_64` variant of QEMU. While we have a 32-bit kernel for
now, soon we’ll have a 64-bit one. And since things are backwards compatible,
this works just fine.

```text
-cdrom os.iso
```

We’re going to start QEMU with a CD-ROM drive, and its contents are the
`os.iso` file we made.

That’s it! Here’s the thing, though: while that wasn’t _too_ complicated, it
was a lot of steps. Each time we make a change, we have to go through all these
steps over again. In the next section, we’ll use Make to do all these steps for
us.
